Please read the blog post on 
[Performance tuning Grunt](http://exponential.io/blog/two-tips-to-boost-grunt-performance)
to learn how to read through this repo.

Basically, this repo walks you through the most common / default approach to 
structuring a `Gruntfile.js` and explains why the structure works well for
a small Grunt configuration, but starts to kill performance as your 
configuration grows.
