2. Exponential sets up your project in a few seconds. The project includes a 
   production ready configuration of Mongo, Express, Angular and Node (MEAN).
3. Exponential generates your server-side API.
4. Exponential generates your server-side web pages in Express.
5. And finally, Exponential generates your Angular application.
